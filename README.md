## Problem on odds 
If you are not able to see the odds, you need to register on the website https://www.football-data.org/ and get an API key. Then, you need to subscribe as `Odds Add-On` and start a free trial. After that, you need to replace the API key in the variable token in file `src\app\variablesGlobale.ts` by your own API key.
